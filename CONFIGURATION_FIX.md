# Android Studio Configuration Fix

## Issue Resolved
The "main class not found" error has been fixed by adding the missing Application class.

## What Was Added
1. **RemoteControlApplication.java** - Main application class
2. **Updated AndroidManifest.xml** - References the application class
3. **Fixed Gradle wrapper** - Proper build configuration

## Build Steps Now
1. **Open in Android Studio**
   - File → Open → Select project root folder
   - Wait for Gradle sync

2. **When Asked About Modules**
   - Select **app** module only
   - Click OK

3. **Build APK**
   - Build → Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) → Build APK(s)
   - Wait for completion

4. **Find APK**
   - Location: `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`

## Alternative Command Line Build
```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

The project should now build successfully without configuration errors.
